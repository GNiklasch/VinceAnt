To get from VinceAnt.js to VinceAnt-golfed.js:

(1) Using your favorite text editor, manually remove all /* ... */
block comments and the debugme() function definition at the end,

(2) save the result to an intermediate file,

(3) and run this through the bin/minify-VinceAnt.pl filter.

This last step will remove all //-comments, one-line debugme() calls,
and indentation and much other whitespace including many line endings,
and replace all variable and function identifiers with abbreviations.
The filter rules will need updating when significant amounts of new
identifiers are added to the .js source.

(This isn't strictly necessary -- VinceAnt.js comfortably fits within
the PPCG answer size limit -- but it prevents cluttering up PPCG with
unnecessary formatting / linebreaks / commentary.)

(The answer size limit on https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/ is 65536
characters, which is already larger than the general StackExchange default.
Bear in mind though that code blocks are marked-down by indenting every
line with 4 spaces, which would add back several KB to the code size if
the Perl script didn't run together many shortish lines into a much
smaller number of rather long lines.)
